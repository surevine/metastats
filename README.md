A project that needs a better name

## Summary

An ohloh-like system for scraping source code repositories and pulling together management information.

## Build

./build

## Deploy

./deploy

## Access

You'll probably then want to edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default and add suitable ProxyPass lines. (You could alternatively open up the access to 8080 directly but routing via Apache is probably a Good Thingâ„¢).
